Human Vector (Standard):
  - matter: 0.472
  - existence: 0.566
  - consciousness: 0.570
  - force: 0.577
  - life: 0.584

Latent Vector (Hidden):
  - force: 0.092
  - matter: 0.101
  - energy: 0.117
  - time: 0.118
  - constant: 0.120

3. Calculating deltas and storing relationships...
  High delta detected: space <-> force (Δ=0.484)
  Bridge: Force alters an object's velocity, which in turn changes its position over time, thereby directly influencing the space it occupies.
  High delta detected: space <-> matter (Δ=0.371)
  Bridge: Space curvature by matter influences matter's movement, shaping trajectories through gravitational interaction, thereby intertwining space and matter computationally in dynamical systems.
  High delta detected: space <-> energy (Δ=0.497)
  Bridge: In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle links spatial uncertainty with energy fluctuations, allowing particles to borrow energy from the vacuum for brief moments, bridging space and energy through quantum fluctuations.
  High delta detected: space <-> time (Δ=0.521)
  Bridge: In computation, space and time are dual aspects of resource consumption, where space represents memory usage and time represents processing duration, both inversely linked through algorithm efficiency; optimizing one often trades off the other.
  High delta detected: space <-> constant (Δ=0.639)
  Bridge: A space complexity of O(1) indicates that an algorithm uses a constant amount of space, independent of the input size, meaning the memory usage remains constant throughout the execution of the algorithm regardless of the problem's scale.
